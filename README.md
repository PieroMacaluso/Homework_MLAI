# Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Homework
Repository of my Homework for the course "Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence" of Prof. Barbara Caputo
(a.y. 2018/2019).

## Content of the repository
There is a folder for each homework which contains the **text**, the **source code** and the **report**.

I suggest to read the report in order to better understand the content of the script.
